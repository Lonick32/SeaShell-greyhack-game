## INSTALL ##
# FILESYSTEM #<br>
1.) Use installer to create the required file structure, (*be sure to launch as home user*) alternatively you can: <br>
*create a folder named src, and place all scripts inside of it via the game code editor <br>
 <br>
-- You can pass the src code from here to the files, then easily compile them all using the installer <br>
-- adjust the paths for the refernce code in main.src and payload.src <br>
ex: import_code("/home/USER/src/utils.src") -- only if done manually !!
# MANUAL COMPILE #<br>
-- You will need to compile the following files in this order, name the binary the same as the src<br><br>
<br> MAIN PROGRAM <br><br>
1.) utils.src --> ** MUST ALLOW IMPORTS **<br>
2.) core.src --> ** MUST ALLOW IMPORTS **<br>
3.) modules.src --> ** MUST ALLOW IMPORTS **<br>
4.) main.src --> RENAME TO ss <br>
Once complete, the only required filed are ss 
# LOCAL DB # (NPC PW hashes)<br>
1.) Youll need the dictionary files from https://github.com/linuxgruven/dictionary<br>
2.) The script will ask you to paste the contents into the script, using CTRL+SHIFT+V copy the correspnding.src to the terminal running installer.<br>
3.) You will be prompted for your user in order for the builder script to build the hashes <br>
4. The installer script can be ran in stages, or provides a full installation. 

DELETE ALL SRC FILES ONCE YOU HAVE SUCCESFULLY RAN SS<br>
